            <p>Founded in May 2022, Clay and Fire Jewellery is a handmade jewellery business, focusing on creating 
                jewellery that is both perfect for everyday wear but can also be added to transition from day to night. 
            </p>
            <p>The majority of our jewellery is created using polymer clay. This is due to its durability, vibrancy and 
                lightweight feel. Even our larger pieces, especially earrings, can be worn all day without irritation.

            <p>We value the planet, that's why we create our pieces as they are ordered, ensuring we use only the required

            <p>We endeavour to continuously improve our impact on the environment and develop our sustainability strategies to 
                look after the world whilst doing what we love - making jewellery that our customers love and wear on a regular 
                basis.
